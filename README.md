# hashme

This repository contains an incomplete collection of mostly naively implemented secure hash algorithms.
You can see it as an exercise.

## Usage of hashme

```
./hashme <filename> [-c|--check]
```

* <filename> is the file where you store your calculated hash values
* -c or --check compares the computed hash from your input message to the hash values in the file specified and gives response via std output
